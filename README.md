# Daily-Git-Commit

Commit to repo every day for the perfect commit streak

## Requirments

`pip install git-python`

## Setup

1. 	Download this repository.
2. 	Create your own repository on your GitHub account.
3. 	It's very important to first commit the `update_me.yaml` file first before you begin the daily commit.
4. 	That's really it.. Assuming your logged into git on your system (if that plays a factor) it should commit straight to what ever repository you wish.
5.	This uses the `.git` folder to commit files. So you could use this script and modify it to commit every repository on your system in-case you forget.

## WHY?!

Only because I wanted to. I hate to see my git commit stats have gaps, and so I made this SUPER simple script to create a commit to this repository to bring up my commit streak :P, and to fill in the gaps where I don't commit on one day. Again this is just a silly project and has no purpose besides to 'cure my ocd' for a perfect commit streak :D. I hope if you have the same issue this script will help.
